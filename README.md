# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

## About

I studied advanced data structures and algorithms in high school. After participating in my last IOI (International Olympiad in Informatics) in 2017, I am no longer studying competitive programming. Now, I am challenging myself into a new field of computer science.

## Result

I won two silver medals. \
